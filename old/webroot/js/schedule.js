Miller",start:new Date(1294857000000),room:"D",difficulty:"Beginner",technology:".NET",track:"Other Track",abstract:"  FubuMVC is an MVC style framework for web development on the .Net platform. FubuMVC was born out of frustrations with ASP.Net MVC&#x2019;s technical limitations and takes a very different philosophy based on composition, minimizing the intrusiveness of the framework into your application code, and taking more advantage of &#x201C;convention over configuration&#x201D; to reduce repetition and eliminate mistakes. In this workshop we&#x2019;ll explore the FubuMVC framework, its capabilities, and take a look at how my team at Dovetail takes advantage of FubuMVC&#x2019;s unique abilities. Along the way we&#x2019;ll talk about:    &#xA0;    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* Your very first FubuMVC application. How to bootstrap the application, some basics about how the framework works at configuration, and the run time model.    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* Conventions, conventions, conventions. I&#x2019;ll show you how to exploit FubuMVC&#x2019;s configuration model and philosophy of composition to write your project&#x2019;s conventions for basically everything in the framework. We&#x2019;ll also look at how to simply reuse existing conventions from other people.    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* \"Dependency Injection Turtles all the way down.\" FubuMVC was built from the ground up with the idea that all of its own composition and scope handling would be done with existing IoC tools.    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* \"One Model In, One Model Out.\" From the very beginning this concept has been core to the way FubuMVC has been architected and built. I&#x2019;ll explain what this concept means and show some examples that will demonstrate why this design idea is so advantageous.    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* Extensible model binding. I&#x2019;ll show you how to add new functionality and policies into FubuMVC&#x2019;s model binding support to reduce repetitive code in your system.    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* Url resolution. One of my personal criticisms of ASP.Net MVC is the very poor way that it handles Url lookup. I&#x2019;ll show you how FubuMVC&#x2019;s url registration scheme reduces the routing errors and duplication as well as making navigation easier in the application architecture.    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* Html conventions. The Html convention support in FubuMVC goes far, far beyond the capabilities of any of its .Net competitors and I&#x2019;ll show several usages for it including integration with field level authorization rules and validation rules. I&#x2019;ll also show you how you can package and reuse Html conventions across multiple projects.    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* HtmlTags. Part of FubuMVC is the HtmlTags model that can be used to quickly and effectively generate html snippets in server side code. I&#x2019;ll show you how HtmlTags enable so much of the power of FubuMVC&#x2019;s html conventions and html helpers and how you can build your own html helpers at will.    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* Partial Requests. Learn how to modularize complex pages and share more code across pages.    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* Authorization integration. We&#x2019;ll learn how to apply authorization policies and rules to endpoints in the system and also how to plug in your own &#x201C;special&#x201D; authorization rules.    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* Navigation Models. Restricting access is more than just tossing up 403 codes, so I&#x2019;ll show you how FubuMVC can reuse authorization rules for navigation.    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* Validation and Localization integration.    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* Packaging. Work is ongoing right now on a packaging architecture for the concepts of &#x201C;areas&#x201D; or &#x201C;slices&#x201D; or even &#x201C;engines&#x201D; that we feel will set the new standard for extensibility in .Net web development. I will show how you can use packaging to make your own application easier to deploy, how to divide a large solution into distinct areas, how to reuse existing packages in the FubuMVC ecosystem, and how to support customer specific extensions in your application.

The hardware design files and schematics are all posted, the C++ firmware shared on github, the Java and Python application code is shared on googlecode and github, and the entire toolchain accepts files created on both proprietary and open source design tools. In addition to a rundown of the technologies that have come together to make ideas into solid objects, there will be a practical demonstration on a Makerbot Cupcake. "}));

The developer who\'s new to iOS can go only so far with Objective-C and the UIKit frameworks and their modern friends before he or she discovers the need to go deeper. But what\'s down there? This session digs down into the iOS stack to show the lower levels of the platform\'s APIs: the Media Layer, Core Services, and the Core OS Layer. As we go, we\'ll have to abandon Objective-C in favor of plain ol\' C, which is used for the Core Foundation framework that does the heavy lifting for Cocoa Touch\'s strings, collections, memory management, I/O and more. We\'ll also look at specialized low-level frameworks for security (including certificate management and the confounding but useful Keychain), CPU-accelerated math and DSP functions, high performance graphics and sound, and more.

Unfortunately, it seems as though those pieces of code that talk to a database are not tested as thoroughly or rigorously as our other pieces of code. This is problematic as this code is probably the most important in the code base. In this talk I will describe tools and techniques that you can use to aid in testing this code. I will present a simple database (a phone book) and then describe how you could unit test the data access code that talks to that database. These unit tests will make use of available open-source mocking frameworks to allow a developer to make sure that his data access code builds the queries and parameters sets accurately, as well as ensures that the data access code deals with results and database failures appropriately. Due to the mocking, no actual database is needed for the unit testing. I will then describe the benefits and the shortcomings of pure unit testing when working with data access code, and move on to describe integration tests. These tests will work with a running database (either stand-alone or in-memory). I will show how using open source tools like spring\'s testing support and liquibase, you can accurately test your database and its accessing code. Depending on your database requirements you may also be able to use an in-memory database to reduce the fragility of those tests. I hope this talk with introduce the attender to some new tools, and some re-usable techniques for making sure that data access code is well tested."}));

Abstract: This presentation will be a case study where a small company developed cutting-edge facial recognition software in the form of a single executable. Unfortunately, customers demanded a service that would scale to thousands of videos processed per day. Using a collection of web services offered by Amazon (others can be used) and some PHP as glue, the presenter will show how a cloud-based infrastructure was built to provide that service without having to change the original binary. The resulting solution exhibits that following characteristics: 1. Self-healing: if one or more of the servers die, the cluster will recover and no request is lost or goes unserviced. 2. Customer platform agnostic: since the final solution is accessible as a web service, it can be used from any machine that is able to submit GET/POST HTTP requests. 3. Self-scaling: the servers in the cluster are collectively responsible for monitoring and scaling the number of instances in the cluster. 4. Generic service architecture: the infrastructure was designed such that it can be used for any kinds of processing or service, not just video processing. 5. Stability: since processing and administrative responsibilities are distributed among all servers in the cluster, there is no single point of failure that can bring down the whole system. The attendees will come away with a concrete understanding of the benefits cloud-based components and infrastructure offer beyond traditional software development and architecture."}));

Join us for an extremely demo-heavy look at the new code visualization, UML, and architectural validation tools which allow you to model domain-specific problem domains and maintain proper control and visibility of your software systems.

Thrift seeks to simplify one aspect of distributed development in that it provides a both a software stack and a code generation facility to build services. This advanced session will cover setup and use of the Thrift software and IDL. I will discuss and demonstrate the strengths of the stack via a simple chat server, which also demonstrates some of the weaknesses and pitfalls of using Thrift. These services are scalable and cross-platform as well as being able to work seamlessly across a wide variety of languages. Thrift was originally developed at Facebook and was open sourced in 2007. Experience with another IDL and with RPC mechanisms will be very helpful. Session code will be in Ruby, PHP, and Java. "}));

The result changed the way sourceforge.net works, the way our company (now geek.net) writes software, and what technologies we use. In this talk, I\'ll tell the story of the fossfor.us project, what we did right, what we did wrong, and how our technical decisions worked out for us."}));

You are definitely feeling the peer pressure to become one of those Azure cool kids, aren\'t you? Well, then this session will make you cool again. We will take an introductory look at cloud computing, and how Microsoft\'s cloud services operating system, Windows Azure, fits into the picture. We will also explore some common scenarios and potential roadblocks in working in the cloud. Finally, we\'ll see just how easy it is to leverage your existing .NET development skills and tools to develop a solution that runs in Windows Azure. By the time we are finished, you\'ll be able to hold your head high in the clouds with the other cool kids."}));

The leveraged systems range from green-screen to mobile web using technologies such as ASP.NET web forms, iSeries, MQ, Java, SOAP and POX web services. The third party systems support business functions including order processing (CommercialWare), search (IBM OmniFind Discovery Edition, Baynote Social Search), recommendations (Baynote Product Recommendations), product ratings (Bazaarvoice), international shipping (FiftyOne E4X), and mobile (Digby). In examining these components, we will discuss design ideas you may use in your own development and integration pitfalls to avoid."}));

This pull model makes iterating over sets of data and performing filtering, transformation, and aggregation operations easy through LINQ. However, the pull model breaks down in asynchronous and event driven environments. In evaluating the options, we discovered that the IObserverable interface and the push model were effectively analogous to the pull model of IEnumerable. As a result, we can make event driven asynchronous progamming easier and more declarative by using the Reactive Framework and LINQ to Events. "}));

These days, your interactions with web application cause real work to be performed. Work that a web server isn\'t fit to handle. Imaging your user has performed an action that requires an email to go out. Do you want your web application server sitting there firing off this email? Do you want that web server process hanging there not responding to any other requests? Wouldn\'t it be better to fire off a request to a server who\'s sole purpose was to handle emails out from your application? This is where messaging comes into play. We\'ll discuss how incorporating a messaging layer to your applications can help you with your flexibility and scalability. We\'ll demonstrate why you would want to separate the actual work a users requests from the web request itself. And we\'ll discuss using Celery, a python library, to interact with RabbitMQ, an amazingly flexible and powerful messaging server."}));

The truth is that functional programming has a rich history of solving the same real world problems that imperative and object orient programming have solved. In this talk, you\'ll learn to use F# to go beyond the basics of functional programming and apply it to practical problems. You\'ll see the anatomy of an F# application and learn some functional techniques to add to your programming toolbox. A basic knowledge of immutability, side effects, and higher order functions is assumed for this talk, but you\'ll learn how to apply some intermediate level functional programming techniques."}));

As developers, we write code that checks code, ensuring that the outcome matches some expected result. But, are we really? As end-users (which includes each one of us from time to time), when we ask a question, we don\'t just expect our answer to be right, we expect it to be right now. So as developers, why are we only validating for accuracy? Why aren\'t we going for speed? During this session we\'ll discuss meeting the performance needs of an application, including developing a performance specification, measuring application performance from stand-alone testing through unit testing, using tools ranging from Team Foundation Server to the command line, and asserting on these measurements to ensure that all expectations are met. Your application does \"right.\" Let\'s focus on \"right now.\""}));

The first problem is, there are plenty of web frameworks to choose from and each one looks very similar to other. This does not help us when time comes to decide which Java framework to use for the next project. The second problem in the Java web development space is the boilerplate code and configuration required by some frameworks which makes building simple crud applications couple of weeks effort. The obvious question is, whether there is hope for Java developers to have fun again building web applications or we all have to move to promising world of grails and rails? The answer is yes it is still possible to have fun building web applications in Java if you select the right framework. Play is a Java (and soon Scala) framework for building web applications that brings fun back into Java web development. I know the common reaction to the answer is &#x201C;oh no, not another framework&#x201D; but smart defaults, conventions, powerful JPA and REST makes play framework one of the most exciting framework in the Java land. In this presentation we will introduce play framework to the audience through examples. We will show how to build fully functional web application using Play framework without hassle. By end of the presentation it will be clear that problems with the current Java web development is not the problem of the language but rather the existing frameworks that we use to build web application and play addresses those problems nicely. This makes play a very good framework for building Java web apps."}));

However, Cocoa Touch lacks some things that make writing 2d games much more pleasant. Cocos2d provides most of those things (note that Cocoa and Cocos are not related in any way). This intermediate session will demonstrate the creation of a simple 2d game using Cocos2d for the iPhone/iPad (developing universal apps will be covered). The game will also use the audio engine from Cocos2d for sound effects and music. This session will provide a solid introduction to using Cocos2d for games and media-intensive applications for the iOS platform. Cocos2d for iOS is an Objective-C framework for building 2D games, demos, and other graphical/interactive applications. It is easy to use with a familiar API (if you have used Cocos2d for python). Cocos2d is easy to integrate and extend. It is also very fast and has a friendly license (it is used by many popular games). Participants should be familiar with iOS application development and XCode. "}));
