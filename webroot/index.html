    <b>Abstract: </b>The Rails Rumble is a 48-hour innovation competition in which teams of up to four developers embrace their environmental constraints to create a number of compelling microapps with Ruby and Rails. In this panel we’ll talk to a number of Rumble participants and discover the tips, tricks, and techniques they used to successfully launch innovative web properties in an extremely short time frame.<br><br>Panelists will include a number of winners and other developers/designers who performed impressive feats during both the 2007, 2008, and 2009 contests. Questions will be taken before the conference starts, but attendees should come prepared with lots of questions for the panelists, such as:<br><br>How they leveraged Rails and open source software to help them succeed.<br>How they scoped their projects and structured their applications to enable them to launch early and iterate often.<br>How they embraced the mantra of “simplest thing that could possibly work”, removing extraneous features and setting reasonable goals for themselves.<br>How they found partners whose skills complemented their own, and how they organized their team.<br>General productivity tips and work habit recommendations.<br>Their advice will be applicable to both future innovation competitions (such as the upcoming Rails Rumbles) as well as to any project that attendees may hope to bootstrap in their own copious spare time. We’ll also discuss how to get involved with innovation competitions and why their condensed nature and marketing opportunities can be a great motivator.<br><br>Panelists include:<br><br>Jonathan Penn - winner 2008<br>Jim Weirich - participant 2008<br>Josh Schramm - participant 2009<br>Matt Yoho - participant 2009<br><br>Moderated by:<br><br>Joe Fiorini<br>Josh Walsh<br>

    <b>Abstract: </b>A number of technologies have been released in recent years which make building data driven applications easier. Starting with the declarative data models in LINQ and the Entity Framework, we are now able to build more dynamic applications quicker and easier than ever before. Building on top of LINQ, we now have the ability to present data dynamically through services (using ADO.Net Data Services) and web applications (using ASP.Net Dynamic Data). In both of these, we can consume our data models the way we need to rather than by needing constantly modify our external contracts (in terms of Stored Procedures or service contracts). The capabilities we have available to us are not limited to the base scaffolding, but allows for significant customization as necessary for our particular business needs. In addition, we can reuse our underlying models to enforce business requirements while retaining these dynamic capabilities. In Part 1, We'll focus on the data and services tiers.</div>

    <b>Abstract: </b>Tons of developers are sticking their toe in the waters of Cocoa development hoping to knock out the next hit iPhone app. If you haven't gotten around to actually getting started, you may want to consider targeting the desktop instead where there isn't yet "an app for that."<br><br>This session is for experienced developers in a C-style language who have considered developing for the iPhone but haven't yet taken the plunge. We'll look at the core Cocoa coding techniques such as delegates, outlets and actions, Key value coding, key value observing, and bindings. You'll get the flavor of developing in Objective-C using Xcode, Interface Builder, and Instruments.</div>

    <b>Abstract: </b>Technical debt, the cost of putting off good development practices, can cripple a project's velocity, flexibility, and quality. This presentation will focus on a number of common anti-patterns such as "sensitive tests" which are brittle and overly coupled to odd situations which cause them to fail. Having identified these behaviours, we’ll look at techniques to firstly quantify the impacts via real world costing examples, after which we'll walk through mitigation strategies such as buying components of a solution versus developing everything from scratch. You'll leave this session with a better idea of how to avoid these pitfalls, and how to pull yourself out of them if you do end up therein.</div>

    <b>Abstract: </b>The first book on Domain-Driven Design was published in 2003, authored by Eric Evans, who first coined the term and distilled the time-tested principles and patterns that make up the practice of DDD. In recent years, simplification and increased testability through frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and others has substantially reduced the complexity of application infrastructure, allowing teams to turn their focus to honing their approach to software design. Domain-Driven Design meets practitioners in that quest with principles, practices, and process to recapture the spirit of software excellence that has been lost in so many of today's technology practices.<br><br>This talk will introduce the foundations of Domain-Driven Design, and present several facets of DDD in action:<br><br>* How models are chosen and evaluated<br>* How multiple models coexist<br>* How patterns help to avoid common pitfalls, such as overly-interconnected models<br>* How developers and domain experts together in a DDD team engage in deeper exploration of their problem domain and make that understanding tangible as a practical software design</div>

    <b>Abstract: </b>Funky Java, Objective Scala<br><br>Session Title: Funky Java, Objective Scala<br><br>Tagline: Polyglot programming is here, and can improve your style. Suggestions on how to inject a little more functional style into your Java, and temper Scala with a mix of Object Oriented and Functional style.<br><br>Abstract:<br><br>Recently, while the Java platform has been going from strength to strength, improving both performance and support for alternative languages, the Java language has started to appear less exciting than many of the alternatives that now run on the JVM. There is a lot to be said for the modern features of many of these new alternatives, but does that mean the fat lady has sung for Java?<br><br>Not so, while we might still not have closures or properties, there are many new and interesting libraries and techniques that can breathe new life and style into your Java source. A stronger emphasis on immutable value objects, use of third party libraries like the Google collections library, DSL like fluent interfaces and more radical ideas like Project Lombok can all help you improve your style, reduce the boilerplate, reduce errors and be more productive with Java. It will bring fun back to your Java development.<br><br>The first part of this session will look at libraries and techniques that you can use with today's Java 6, and a peek ahead to Java 7. Topics covered will include:<br><br>Immutable value classes<br>Builder pattern and fluent APIs<br>Typesafe "Multiple returns" with Pairs and Triples<br>Predicates, functions, constraints, identity maps and more with the Google Collections Library<br><br>At the same time, alternative languages that offer much more than Java are emerging on the JVM. Scala is one interesting option that offers static typing but with the same reduction of boilerplate and incidental complexity as many dynamically typed languages. Scala has a strong functional heritage, but also excellent support for Object Orientation, a fact that can greatly ease the transition to this new language. By starting with a mix of OO and Functional, the learning curve is lowered and the results are immediate. <br><br>In the second part of this session we will look at Scala, it similarities to Java, and it's easy access improvements. Along the way, some functional techniques will be introduced where they make sense, and where they make life easier. This is intended to be like easing into a warm swimming pool rather than diving in at the deep end.<br><br>Aimed at beginner and intermediate developers, this session aims to help you improve your productivity and coding style.<br>

    <b>Abstract: </b>Newer JVM languages such as JRuby, Groovy, and Scala let you work at a higher level than Java. This talk will show you ScalaTest, a new testing tool that will let you work at a higher level than JUnit and TestNG. You'll learn about high-level features of Scala such as traits and self-types, implicit conversions and parameters, functions and closures, and internal DSLs, and see how ScalaTest exploits these features to help you work more productively. You'll see how you can reduce the lines of test code you write by half and more, how to mix Scala into your existing JUnit or TestNG infrastructure, and how to use Scala in various testing styles, including unit testing, behavior-driven development, integration and acceptance testing, and high-level property-based testing. You need not already know Scala to attend this talk, as you will be taught just enough Scala to understand the examples.</div>

    <b>Abstract: </b>There’s a storm brewing. You may have felt the increased pressure when you last typed “CREATE DATABASE latest_project;” into your MySQL console - or you might have been seeding the clouds in an attempt to bring the thunder on faster. <br><br>The name of that storm? NoSQL. <br><br>New key-value stores seem to pop up daily, document databases like CouchDB and MongoDB get a great deal of press, and RDF itself is built as a graph database. Given that, and the fact that a number of domains just don’t map onto relational databases very cleanly, it behooves the development community to learn about these alternatives. How do they differ from relational databases? In what situations are they best used? How hard is it to split up a domain model into, say, a relational piece and a document piece - and is this ever worthwhile?<br><br>I’ll answer those questions in this session, and I’ll refer to actual problem domains while illustrating the answers. As it turns out, a document DB like CouchDB works very well for modeling biological taxonomy - and a graph DB like Neo4J is a great fit for the (surprisingly complex) business of comic books. The NoSQL future is wide, varied, and exciting - and it might even have a place for our old friends, the relational DBs.<br>

  <div>
    <b>Difficulty Level: </b>Advanced</div>
  <br><div>
    <b>Abstract: </b>Chances are you code in a language that's either descended from C, inspired by C, or run in an interpreter that itself is written in C. Still... do you actually know how to code in C? Despite its long-standing position as a sort of "lingua franca", an agreed-upon common language, more and more developers are putting together successful, satisfying careers, without ever learning this seminal language. But what if you have to call into C code from your favorite scripting language, or use APIs like OpenGL that are written to be called from C? Many developers find C very challenging, particularly its manual memory-management and other low-level concerns. In this session, we'll show you why you shouldn't be afraid of C, how you can use the skills you already have from the languages you code in today, and how to master structs, enums, typedefs, malloc(), free(), and the rest of C's sharp edges. Examples will be from the point-of-view of the C-skewing iPhone SDK, but will be designed to be broadly applicable and platform-agnostic.</div>

We will emphasize the benefits of learning from others vs. creating an interface from scratch.<br><br>Competitive analysis will be covered in depth as a quick, easy (and safe) way to determine what features are commonly provided to users. By studying these existing standards the project’s inventory of requirements will be representative of the users expectations. The resulting interface will benefit from others experience and ideas, without endangering the organization.<br><br>This session will also explore additional methods that can improve software development by providing accurate information about users. Paper prototyping (low fidelity prototypes put in front of users) will be explored as a way to get fast feedback saves time and resources by allowing the team to iterate quickly based on the feedback without starting actual development.</div>

    <b>Abstract: </b>I have been practicing and coaching on kanban for 10 months now. I am passionate about kanban because without a lot of ceremony and time, I can get a team to self organize and start communicating. Since constraints become visible, it allows people to be more willing to go out of their comfort zone and thus wear any hat that it takes to produce quality software. Seeing constraints, pulling value and eliminating waste is the goal of practicing kanban. This would be a "kanban explained" session for those who are not familiar with this practice. I use physical boards to illustrate the concepts and encourage good dialogue. We will discuss several types of kanban boards such as WIP, backlog and retrospectives.<br><br>This presentation has been tested at many user group meetings, at clients and in the open space forum at Agile 2009. The session takes 1 hour to present, 1 1/2 hours to have good dialogue during the presentation. <br><br>Kanban, while not a new concept, nor complex - it is often misunderstood by those who don't practice it. Intended audience is for people that understand agile story wall concepts and whole team. The best audience is a Scrum master who will learn how kanban can take their craft to the next level of a self organizing teams by seeing, not hearing about constraints.</div>

The open source Flex SDK and your back-end of choice are a perfect combination of technologies for building rich, sexy software - for the web and the desktop. Flex applications can run in the browser using the ubiquitous Flash Player or on the desktop using Adobe AIR. In both instances your back-end of choice can be used for the server-side of the application. The communication between your back-end and Flex front-end can be a number of different communication protocols including SOAP, RESTful XML, JSON, and AMF. Using lots of live coding examples and demonstrations this session will cover the basics of using Flex to build sexy software for the web and the desktop.</div>

    <b>Abstract: </b>The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that improve an Object Oriented design. They are:<br><br>* Single Responsibility Principle<br>* Open/Closed Princip<br>* Liskov Substitution Principle<br>* Interface Segregation Principle<br>* Dependency Inversion Principle<br><br>The SOLID principles were written with a statically typed language (such as C++ or Java) in mind. What do the SOLID principles mean to a dynamic/flexible language like Ruby? This talk will focus on how SOLID and Ruby interact, how to create well designed Ruby software, and to suggest possibilities for new design principles for dynamic languages.<br><br>ABSTRACT<br><br>The 5 SOLID design principles form a great foundation for understanding good Object Oriented design. But the SOLID principles were originally conceived with statically typed OO languages, such as C++ and Java, in mind. How well do these principles hold up when the implementation language is Ruby? Are the principles just as pertinent as they were in Java, or does the dynamic nature of Ruby change what we mean by good design? In this presentation we will examine the SOLID principles to understand their core purpose, and then run them through the "Ruby Filter" to see if any of these core principles survive. By understanding these principles, we become better Ruby programmers.<br>

    <b>Abstract: </b>Few tools have changed the way I work as much as the git source control system. Its distributed nature and lightweight branching and merging have made it possible for me to massage my code base in ways I couldn't have even imagined before using git.<br><br>However, git has a reputation for being hard to learn. Because of its rather different approach to source control issues, many of the techniques we have learned in other source control systems do not translate cleanly when using git.<br><br>In this talk, we avoid the whole "fear of git" issue by not talking about git at all. Instead we introduce the "Custom Source Control" (CSC) system and build it up from first principles. In the end, we will ahve a completely functional, distributed source control system. And because each step in our journey of building CSC is simple and straight forward, we end up with a completely understandable system.<br><br>So, this talk is not about git. But attendees will end up with a deeper understanding of the principles behind git.<br><br>Did I mention this talk is not about git? No, really! It's not. &lt;wink/&gt;<br>

    <b>Abstract: </b>Building multi-threaded applications can be hard work. So come learn a number of techniques for developing software solutions that take advantage of today’s multi-core processors. In true CodeMash fashion, the session starts by laying a foundation of concurrency basics using C++. The bulk of the session then looks at all of the various techniques for parallelizing “work” in .NET 3.5 using C#, while avoiding a number of “gotchas”. Finally, the session concludes with how these techniques will make it easy to develop parallel solutions with the changes coming in Visual Studio 2010, .NET 4.0, and F#. </div>

    <b>Abstract: </b>The Ruby community has always understood the importance of testing. They strive to make applications more testable while improving the approaches and tools they use. As a result, they have created some amazing frameworks and best practices to support testing, both from the developers and testers point of view. While this is great for Ruby developers, it also is extremely beneficial for ASP.net and C# developers. This session provides an insight into the Ruby world and how you can take advantage of the existing frameworks to create readable, maintainable and valuable acceptance tests for ASP.net based web applications testing different parts of the application including the business logic as well as the user interface in an automated fashion. The session will explain how frameworks such as RSpec and Cucumber can be used to verify not only that the application works as expected, but the customers are receiving the features they require with a correct implementation. Finally, Ben will look at IronRuby and how that fits into the process of testing C#ASP.net applications using the Ruby language. </div>

  <br><div>
    <b>Abstract: </b>The Java platform ecosystem harbors many languages besides Java. In that vast set of languages there is one that has received the title of “Next Generation Java” but not because it dismisses Java, not at all! it is because it embraces the language and extends it in a friendly and fluent way. That language is Groovy. Testing Java code can be cumbersome, specially when rigid limits as verbose syntax and static typing get in the way. Groovy can help you write less code while retaining the same behavior, it can also test your Java production code without any special bridge between languages. Groovy integrates seamlessly with all Java libraries, testing frameworks and IDEs, which means you won’t be throwing away your Java knowledge, you’ll just make it groovier.<br><br>This session will demonstrate Groovy aiding Java tests in key areas as code verbosity, mocking and producing/consuming XML. </div>

    <b>Abstract: </b>Building a desktop application is a hard task, there are some many things to keep track of that many projects simply fail to meet their goals. Setting up the project structure keeping each artifact on a well identified location given its responsibility and type, defining the base schema for managing the application's life cycle, making sure the build is properly setup, and more. These are recurring tasks that should be handled by a tool or better yet, a framework. Griffon is such a framework. Inspired by the Grails framework Griffon aims to bring the same productivity gains to desktop development, there are so many traits shared by both frameworks that a Grails developer should be able to pick up the pace quickly.</div>

    <b>Abstract: </b>Return on Investment is key for large and small organizations in these risky times. A key mitigator of ROI risk is the avoidance of capital expenditure on IT infrastructure. While traditional Application Service Provider style hosting services do fit this bill, there is a new service on the horizon that has key benefits over the ASP model - cloud computing. Cloud computing leverages virtualized resources to isolate the developer and user from details of the infrastructure, while spreading infrastructure capital expenses over a large number of hosted applications. Bill will discuss the realities of hosted applications, including the current popular ASP models, and compare them to cloud computing. There will be an overview of cloud computing architecture and strategy. He will end with a comparison of various commercial cloud services, including Google AppEngine, Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure.</div>

    <b>Abstract: </b>Developers spend way too much of their time performing tedious and error prone tasks as part of their day to day work. Manual code reviews, waiting on slow and broken builds, fixing tests gone wild, firefighting scary releases--it never ends. But, fear not! There are tools and techniques for building a disciplined automated environment to rescue the developer, increase productivity and reduce monotony.  This session will briefly espouse the need for source control and issue tracking, but the focus will be primarily on what it takes to create high quality automatable builds and tests, and how to get them automated. Lessons learned while at Google and Netflix will be shared, as well as experience with a few specific products in key categories.</div>

  <br><div>
    <b>Abstract: </b>A large number of Agile adoption initiatives start at a grassroots level among software developers who have grown uncomfortable with the blatant inefficiencies of classic approaches to software development. The teams who succeed often find themselves working more efficiently, but the impact of their success is hindered. They are still relegated to taking large functional specifications and digesting them into iterations of work, with little if any feedback from the business side of the house. A series of successful sprints can still be met with the cliche "that's not what we wanted" response, leaving development teams relegated to the "well that's what you wrote" response. Until the business people are participating in iterative feedback and realizing the flexibility and freedom they have in working with these Agile teams, there will always be a ceiling on their success.<br><br>Attendees of this talk will be guided through pragmatic, proven approaches for building that bridge to the business representatives. A thorough treatment of how user stories can be used as an effective tool that allows business and development sides of the house to meet in the middle, as well as when and how to bend in order to move the adoption process forward. It will also cover the sometimes subtle pitfalls and hotspots of promoting a fully Agile process with participating business team members, and ways to hopefully allow good deeds to continue to go unpunished.</div>

    <b>Abstract: </b>You have heard about Ruby. You have heard about Ruby on Rails. What you have not seen is how they are different from the tools you are using. This talk is about code. C#, Java and Ruby, side-by-side, solving the same problems you face daily. This talk is focused solely on how the languages are different - beyond the surface of syntax and into the heart of design. We will show the difference between a purely object-oriented language and a class based language. We will show you what problem an IOC container solves, and why you don't need one in Ruby. This talk is not about selling a language, but comparing them. This is not about demonstrating features, but demonstrating benefits in real world code examples. </div>
