Setting up the project structure keeping each artifact on a well identified location given its responsibility and type, defining the base schema for managing the application\'s life cycle, making sure the build is properly setup, and more. These are recurring tasks that should be handled by a tool or better yet, a framework. Griffon is such a framework. Inspired by the Grails framework Griffon aims to bring the same productivity gains to desktop development, there are so many traits shared by both frameworks that a Grails developer should be able to pick up the pace quickly."}));

Still... do you actually know how to code in C? Despite its long-standing position as a sort of &amp;quot;lingua franca&amp;quot;, an agreed-upon common language, more and more developers are putting together successful, satisfying careers, without ever learning this seminal language. But what if you have to call into C code from your favorite scripting language, or use APIs like OpenGL that are written to be called from C? Many developers find C very challenging, particularly its manual memory-management and other low-level concerns. In this session, we\'ll show you why you shouldn\'t be afraid of C, how you can use the skills you already have from the languages you code in today, and how to master structs, enums, typedefs, malloc(), free(), and the rest of C\'s sharp edges.

Given that, and the fact that a number of domains just don&#x2019;t map onto relational databases very cleanly, it behooves the development community to learn about these alternatives. How do they differ from relational databases? In what situations are they best used? How hard is it to split up a domain model into, say, a relational piece and a document piece - and is this ever worthwhile?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#x2019;ll answer those questions in this session, and I&#x2019;ll refer to actual problem domains while illustrating the answers.

Suggestions on how to inject a little more functional style into your Java, and temper Scala with a mix of Object Oriented and Functional style.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently, while the Java platform has been going from strength to strength, improving both performance and support for alternative languages, the Java language has started to appear less exciting than many of the alternatives that now run on the JVM. There is a lot to be said for the modern features of many of these new alternatives, but does that mean the fat lady has sung for Java?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not so, while we might still not have closures or properties, there are many new and interesting libraries and techniques that can breathe new life and style into your Java source. A stronger emphasis on immutable value objects, use of third party libraries like the Google collections library, DSL like fluent interfaces and more radical ideas like Project Lombok can all help you improve your style, reduce the boilerplate, reduce errors and be more productive with Java. It will bring fun back to your Java development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first part of this session will look at libraries and techniques that you can use with today\'s Java 6, and a peek ahead to Java 7. Topics covered will include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Immutable value classes&lt;br&gt;Builder pattern and fluent APIs&lt;br&gt;Typesafe &amp;quot;Multiple returns&amp;quot; with Pairs and Triples&lt;br&gt;Predicates, functions, constraints, identity maps and more with the Google Collections Library&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the same time, alternative languages that offer much more than Java are emerging on the JVM. Scala is one interesting option that offers static typing but with the same reduction of boilerplate and incidental complexity as many dynamically typed languages. Scala has a strong functional heritage, but also excellent support for Object Orientation, a fact that can greatly ease the transition to this new language. By starting with a mix of OO and Functional, the learning curve is lowered and the results are immediate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the second part of this session we will look at Scala, it similarities to Java, and it\'s easy access improvements. Along the way, some functional techniques will be introduced where they make sense, and where they make life easier. This is intended to be like easing into a warm swimming pool rather than diving in at the deep end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aimed at beginner and intermediate developers, this session aims to help you improve your productivity and coding style.&lt;br&gt;"}));

I am passionate about kanban because without a lot of ceremony and time, I can get a team to self organize and start communicating. Since constraints become visible, it allows people to be more willing to go out of their comfort zone and thus wear any hat that it takes to produce quality software. Seeing constraints, pulling value and eliminating waste is the goal of practicing kanban. This would be a &amp;quot;kanban explained&amp;quot; session for those who are not familiar with this practice. I use physical boards to illustrate the concepts and encourage good dialogue. We will discuss several types of kanban boards such as WIP, backlog and retrospectives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This presentation has been tested at many user group meetings, at clients and in the open space forum at Agile 2009. The session takes 1 hour to present, 1 1/2 hours to have good dialogue during the presentation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanban, while not a new concept, nor complex - it is often misunderstood by those who don\'t practice it. Intended audience is for people that understand agile story wall concepts and whole team.

Following this introduction we will discuss some specific use cases for MongoDB. This will include examples of interacting with MongoDB from several different languages. We will review some of the advanced features of MongoDB and discuss how they can be put to good use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Questions and discussion will be encouraged throughout the presentation, but some time will be allotted at the end specifically for Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes: &lt;br&gt;- I filed this under Architecture and Design, but wasn\'t really sure where exactly it belonged. If you think it belongs in a different track feel free to adjust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- I also filed under Other Languages because there was no &amp;quot;All Languages&amp;quot; category. There are MongoDB drivers for all of the listed languages (and more), so the talk really applies to developers working in any of them."}));

In this session, we\'ll introduce Tapestry&lt;br&gt;and explain its innovative approach to building fast, complex, reliable applications&lt;br&gt;from simple and reusable components. Along the way, we\'ll demonstrate the features&lt;br&gt;that make Tapestry so fun and productive: including live class reloading and &lt;br&gt;convention over configuration: we\'ll show how these result in minute amounts of code&lt;br&gt;to accomplish big goals, and how Tapestry brings scripting language productivity &lt;br&gt;within reach of Java developers without sacrificing any of Java\'s inherent speed and power.&lt;br&gt;"}));

That\'s Clojure, which&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;feels like a general-purpose language beamed back from the near&lt;br&gt;future.&amp;quot; Clojure embraces functional programming with immutable data&lt;br&gt;types and first class functions. It is fully interoperable with&lt;br&gt;Java. Clojure\'s approach to concurrency includes asynchonous Agents,&lt;br&gt;and Software Transactional Memory. Clojure is fast, elegant, dynamic,&lt;br&gt;and scalable: a language for the future, today.&lt;br&gt;"}));

We\'ll look at the core Cocoa coding techniques such as delegates, outlets and actions, Key value coding, key value observing, and bindings. You\'ll get the flavor of developing in Objective-C using Xcode, Interface Builder, and Instruments."}));

Manual code reviews, waiting on slow and broken builds, fixing tests gone wild, firefighting scary releases--it never ends. But, fear not! There are tools and techniques for building a disciplined automated environment to rescue the developer, increase productivity and reduce monotony.  This session will briefly espouse the need for source control and issue tracking, but the focus will be primarily on what it takes to create high quality automatable builds and tests, and how to get them automated. Lessons learned while at Google and Netflix will be shared, as well as experience with a few specific products in key categories."}));
