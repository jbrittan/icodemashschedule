There is a lot to be said for the modern features of many of these new alternatives, but does that mean the fat lady has sung for Java?<br><br>Not so, while we might still not have closures or properties, there are many new and interesting libraries and techniques that can breathe new life and style into your Java source. A stronger emphasis on immutable value objects, use of third party libraries like the Google collections library, DSL like fluent interfaces and more radical ideas like Project Lombok can all help you improve your style, reduce the boilerplate, reduce errors and be more productive with Java. It will bring fun back to your Java development.<br><br>The first part of this session will look at libraries and techniques that you can use with today\'s Java 6, and a peek ahead to Java 7. Topics covered will include:<br><br>Immutable value classes<br>Builder pattern and fluent APIs<br>Typesafe \"Multiple returns\" with Pairs and Triples<br>Predicates, functions, constraints, identity maps and more with the Google Collections Library<br><br>At the same time, alternative languages that offer much more than Java are emerging on the JVM. Scala is one interesting option that offers static typing but with the same reduction of boilerplate and incidental complexity as many dynamically typed languages. Scala has a strong functional heritage, but also excellent support for Object Orientation, a fact that can greatly ease the transition to this new language. By starting with a mix of OO and Functional, the learning curve is lowered and the results are immediate. <br><br>In the second part of this session we will look at Scala, it similarities to Java, and it\'s easy access improvements. Along the way, some functional techniques will be introduced where they make sense, and where they make life easier.

What do the SOLID principles mean to a dynamic/flexible language like Ruby? This talk will focus on how SOLID and Ruby interact, how to create well designed Ruby software, and to suggest possibilities for new design principles for dynamic languages. ABSTRACT The 5 SOLID design principles form a great foundation for understanding good Object Oriented design. But the SOLID principles were originally conceived with statically typed OO languages, such as C++ and Java, in mind. How well do these principles hold up when the implementation language is Ruby? Are the principles just as pertinent as they were in Java, or does the dynamic nature of Ruby change what we mean by good design? In this presentation we will examine the SOLID principles to understand their core purpose, and then run them through the \"Ruby Filter\" to see if any of these core principles survive. By understanding these principles, we become better Ruby programmers.<br>"}));

In this fun and interactive session participants will learn the benefits of following respected patterns of interactive design to reduce waste and get fast feedback on initial designs. <br><br>This session will cover concerns regarding intellectual property (IP), and identify guidelines to help developers determine where the line is between studying and stealing. We will emphasize the benefits of learning from others vs. creating an interface from scratch.<br><br>Competitive analysis will be covered in depth as a quick, easy (and safe) way to determine what features are commonly provided to users. By studying these existing standards the project&#x2019;s inventory of requirements will be representative of the users expectations. The resulting interface will benefit from others experience and ideas, without endangering the organization.<br><br>This session will also explore additional methods that can improve software development by providing accurate information about users. Paper prototyping (low fidelity prototypes put in front of users) will be explored as a way to get fast feedback saves time and resources by allowing the team to iterate quickly based on the feedback without starting actual development."}));

They are:<br><br>* Single Responsibility Principle<br>* Open/Closed Princip<br>* Liskov Substitution Principle<br>* Interface Segregation Principle<br>* Dependency Inversion Principle<br><br>The SOLID principles were written with a statically typed language (such as C++ or Java) in mind. What do the SOLID principles mean to a dynamic/flexible language like Ruby? This talk will focus on how SOLID and Ruby interact, how to create well designed Ruby software, and to suggest possibilities for new design principles for dynamic languages.<br><br>ABSTRACT<br><br>The 5 SOLID design principles form a great foundation for understanding good Object Oriented design. But the SOLID principles were originally conceived with statically typed OO languages, such as C++ and Java, in mind. How well do these principles hold up when the implementation language is Ruby? Are the principles just as pertinent as they were in Java, or does the dynamic nature of Ruby change what we mean by good design? In this presentation we will examine the SOLID principles to understand their core purpose, and then run them through the \"Ruby Filter\" to see if any of these core principles survive. By understanding these principles, we become better Ruby programmers.<br>"}));

A key mitigator of ROI risk is the avoidance of capital expenditure on IT infrastructure. While traditional Application Service Provider style hosting services do fit this bill, there is a new service on the horizon that has key benefits over the ASP model - cloud computing. Cloud computing leverages virtualized resources to isolate the developer and user from details of the infrastructure, while spreading infrastructure capital expenses over a large number of hosted applications. Bill will discuss the realities of hosted applications, including the current popular ASP models, and compare them to cloud computing. There will be an overview of cloud computing architecture and strategy. He will end with a comparison of various commercial cloud services, including Google AppEngine, Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure."}));

This session will briefly espouse the need for source control and issue tracking, but the focus will be primarily on what it takes to create high quality automatable builds and tests, and how to get them automated.
