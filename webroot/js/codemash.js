p.description = "<p>Technology/Platform: .NET\nDifficulty Level: Advanced</p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Technical debt, the cost of putting off good development practices, can cripple a project's velocity, flexibility, and quality. This presentation will focus on a number of common anti-patterns such as \"sensitive tests\" which are brittle and overly coupled to odd situations which cause them to fail. Having identified these behaviours, we\u2019ll look at techniques to firstly quantify the impacts via real world costing examples, after which we'll walk through mitigation strategies such as buying components of a solution versus developing everything from scratch. You'll leave this session with a better idea of how to avoid these pitfalls, and how to pull yourself out of them if you do end up therein.</p>\n\n<p>Presented By: Gary Short</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: Gary Short works for Developer Express as the Technical Evangelist on the frameworks team. He has a deep interest in technical architecture, especially in the areas of technical debt and refactoring.

p.description = "<p>Technology/Platform: Other\nDifficulty Level: Beginner</p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Return on Investment is key for large and small organizations in these risky times. A key mitigator of ROI risk is the avoidance of capital expenditure on IT infrastructure. While traditional Application Service Provider style hosting services do fit this bill, there is a new service on the horizon that has key benefits over the ASP model - cloud computing. Cloud computing leverages virtualized resources to isolate the developer and user from details of the infrastructure, while spreading infrastructure capital expenses over a large number of hosted applications. Bill will discuss the realities of hosted applications, including the current popular ASP models, and compare them to cloud computing. There will be an overview of cloud computing architecture and strategy. He will end with a comparison of various commercial cloud services, including Google AppEngine, Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure.</p>\n\n<p>Presented By: Bill Sempf</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: Bill Sempf is an enterprise architect.

p.description = "<p>Technology/Platform: Ruby\nDifficulty Level: Intermediate</p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that improve an Object Oriented design.

What do the SOLID principles mean to a dynamic/flexible language like Ruby? This talk will focus on how SOLID and Ruby interact, how to create well designed Ruby software, and to suggest possibilities for new design principles for dynamic languages.</p>\n\n<p>ABSTRACT</p>\n\n<p>The 5 SOLID design principles form a great foundation for understanding good Object Oriented design. But the SOLID principles were originally conceived with statically typed OO languages, such as C++ and Java, in mind. How well do these principles hold up when the implementation language is Ruby? Are the principles just as pertinent as they were in Java, or does the dynamic nature of Ruby change what we mean by good design? In this presentation we will examine the SOLID principles to understand their core purpose, and then run them through the \"Ruby Filter\" to see if any of these core principles survive. By understanding these principles, we become better Ruby programmers.</p>\n\n<p>Presented By: Jim Weirich</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: Jim Weirich is the Chief Scientist for EdgeCase LLC, a Rails development firm located in Columbus Ohio.

p.description = "<p>Technology/Platform: Other Languages\nDifficulty Level: Advanced</p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Chances are you code in a language that's either descended from C, inspired by C, or run in an interpreter that itself is written in C. Still... do you actually know how to code in C? Despite its long-standing position as a sort of \"lingua franca\", an agreed-upon common language, more and more developers are putting together successful, satisfying careers, without ever learning this seminal language. But what if you have to call into C code from your favorite scripting language, or use APIs like OpenGL that are written to be called from C? Many developers find C very challenging, particularly its manual memory-management and other low-level concerns. In this session, we'll show you why you shouldn't be afraid of C, how you can use the skills you already have from the languages you code in today, and how to master structs, enums, typedefs, malloc(), free(), and the rest of C's sharp edges. Examples will be from the point-of-view of the C-skewing iPhone SDK, but will be designed to be broadly applicable and platform-agnostic.</p>\n\n<p>Presented By: Chris Adamson</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: Chris Adamson is an independent writer, editor, and developer, living in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

In that vast set of languages there is one that has received the title of \u201cNext Generation Java\u201d but not because it dismisses Java, not at all! it is because it embraces the language and extends it in a friendly and fluent way. That language is Groovy. Testing Java code can be cumbersome, specially when rigid limits as verbose syntax and static typing get in the way. Groovy can help you write less code while retaining the same behavior, it can also test your Java production code without any special bridge between languages. Groovy integrates seamlessly with all Java libraries, testing frameworks and IDEs, which means you won\u2019t be throwing away your Java knowledge, you\u2019ll just make it groovier.</p>\n\n<p>This session will demonstrate Groovy aiding Java tests in key areas as code verbosity, mocking and producing/consuming XML.</p>\n\n<p>Presented By: Andres Almiray</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: Andres is a Java/Groovy developer with more than 10 years of experience in software design and development.

Suggestions on how to inject a little more functional style into your Java, and temper Scala with a mix of Object Oriented and Functional style.</p>\n\n<p>Abstract:</p>\n\n<p>Recently, while the Java platform has been going from strength to strength, improving both performance and support for alternative languages, the Java language has started to appear less exciting than many of the alternatives that now run on the JVM. There is a lot to be said for the modern features of many of these new alternatives, but does that mean the fat lady has sung for Java?</p>\n\n<p>Not so, while we might still not have closures or properties, there are many new and interesting libraries and techniques that can breathe new life and style into your Java source. A stronger emphasis on immutable value objects, use of third party libraries like the Google collections library, DSL like fluent interfaces and more radical ideas like Project Lombok can all help you improve your style, reduce the boilerplate, reduce errors and be more productive with Java. It will bring fun back to your Java development.</p>\n\n<p>The first part of this session will look at libraries and techniques that you can use with today's Java 6, and a peek ahead to Java 7. Topics covered will include:</p>\n\n<p>Immutable value classes\nBuilder pattern and fluent APIs\nTypesafe \"Multiple returns\" with Pairs and Triples\nPredicates, functions, constraints, identity maps and more with the Google Collections Library</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, alternative languages that offer much more than Java are emerging on the JVM. Scala is one interesting option that offers static typing but with the same reduction of boilerplate and incidental complexity as many dynamically typed languages. Scala has a strong functional heritage, but also excellent support for Object Orientation, a fact that can greatly ease the transition to this new language. By starting with a mix of OO and Functional, the learning curve is lowered and the results are immediate.</p>\n\n<p>In the second part of this session we will look at Scala, it similarities to Java, and it's easy access improvements. Along the way, some functional techniques will be introduced where they make sense, and where they make life easier. This is intended to be like easing into a warm swimming pool rather than diving in at the deep end.</p>\n\n<p>Aimed at beginner and intermediate developers, this session aims to help you improve your productivity and coding style.</p>\n\n<p>Presented By: Dick Wall</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: Dick Wall is a veteran Java developer and a more recent Scala convert.

p.description = "<p>Technology/Platform: Java\nDifficulty Level: Beginner</p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The first book on Domain-Driven Design was published in 2003, authored by Eric Evans, who first coined the term and distilled the time-tested principles and patterns that make up the practice of DDD. In recent years, simplification and increased testability through frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and others has substantially reduced the complexity of application infrastructure, allowing teams to turn their focus to honing their approach to software design. Domain-Driven Design meets practitioners in that quest with principles, practices, and process to recapture the spirit of software excellence that has been lost in so many of today's technology practices.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will introduce the foundations of Domain-Driven Design, and present several facets of DDD in action:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How models are chosen and evaluated</li>\n<li>How multiple models coexist</li>\n<li>How patterns help to avoid common pitfalls, such as overly-interconnected models</li>\n<li>How developers and domain experts together in a DDD team engage in deeper exploration of their problem domain and make that understanding tangible as a practical software design</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Presented By: Barry Hawkins</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: Barry Hawkins has played various roles in his 13 years in the software industry, from lone developer to team lead to Agile coach and mentor.

p.description = "<p>Technology/Platform: .NET\nDifficulty Level: Intermediate</p>\n\n<p>Abstract: The Ruby community has always understood the importance of testing. They strive to make applications more testable while improving the approaches and tools they use. As a result, they have created some amazing frameworks and best practices to support testing, both from the developers and testers point of view. While this is great for Ruby developers, it also is extremely beneficial for ASP.net and C# developers. This session provides an insight into the Ruby world and how you can take advantage of the existing frameworks to create readable, maintainable and valuable acceptance tests for ASP.net based web applications testing different parts of the application including the business logic as well as the user interface in an automated fashion. The session will explain how frameworks such as RSpec and Cucumber can be used to verify not only that the application works as expected, but the customers are receiving the features they require with a correct implementation. Finally, Ben will look at IronRuby and how that fits into the process of testing C#\ASP.net applications using the Ruby language.</p>\n\n<p>Presented By: Ben Hall</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: Ben Hall is a UK C# developer\tester with a strong passion for software development and loves writing code.

p.description = "<p>Technology/Platform: Other\nDifficulty Level: Beginner</p>\n\n<p>Abstract: I have been practicing and coaching on kanban for 10 months now. I am passionate about kanban because without a lot of ceremony and time, I can get a team to self organize and start communicating. Since constraints become visible, it allows people to be more willing to go out of their comfort zone and thus wear any hat that it takes to produce quality software. Seeing constraints, pulling value and eliminating waste is the goal of practicing kanban. This would be a \"kanban explained\" session for those who are not familiar with this practice. I use physical boards to illustrate the concepts and encourage good dialogue. We will discuss several types of kanban boards such as WIP, backlog and retrospectives.</p>\n\n<p>This presentation has been tested at many user group meetings, at clients and in the open space forum at Agile 2009. The session takes 1 hour to present, 1 1/2 hours to have good dialogue during the presentation.</p>\n\n<p>Kanban, while not a new concept, nor complex - it is often misunderstood by those who don't practice it. Intended audience is for people that understand agile story wall concepts and whole team. The best audience is a Scrum master who will learn how kanban can take their craft to the next level of a self organizing teams by seeing, not hearing about constraints.</p>\n\n<p>Presented By: Jon Stahl</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: Jon's passion is eliminating waste, optimizing the performance of IT teams and helping organizations become lean and agile.

NoSQL.</p>\n\n<p>New key-value stores seem to pop up daily, document databases like CouchDB and MongoDB get a great deal of press, and RDF itself is built as a graph database. Given that, and the fact that a number of domains just don\u2019t map onto relational databases very cleanly, it behooves the development community to learn about these alternatives. How do they differ from relational databases? In what situations are they best used? How hard is it to split up a domain model into, say, a relational piece and a document piece - and is this ever worthwhile?</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ll answer those questions in this session, and I\u2019ll refer to actual problem domains while illustrating the answers. As it turns out, a document DB like CouchDB works very well for modeling biological taxonomy - and a graph DB like Neo4J is a great fit for the (surprisingly complex) business of comic books.

p.description = "<p>Technology/Platform: .NET\nDifficulty Level: Beginner</p>\n\n<p>Abstract: A number of technologies have been released in recent years which make building data driven applications easier. Starting with the declarative data models in LINQ and the Entity Framework, we are now able to build more dynamic applications quicker and easier than ever before. Building on top of LINQ, we now have the ability to present data dynamically through services (using ADO.Net Data Services) and web applications (using ASP.Net Dynamic Data). In both of these, we can consume our data models the way we need to rather than by needing constantly modify our external contracts (in terms of Stored Procedures or service contracts). The capabilities we have available to us are not limited to the base scaffolding, but allows for significant customization as necessary for our particular business needs. In addition, we can reuse our underlying models to enforce business requirements while retaining these dynamic capabilities. In Part 2, we'll look at the UI portion of our web applications and see how we can take advantage of the flexabile data structures we built in part 1.</p>\n\n<p>Presented By: Jim Wooley</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: Jim Wooley is a frequent speaker, member of the INETA Speaker Bureau, MVP, and author of \"LINQ in Action\".

p.description = "<p>Technology/Platform: Java\nDifficulty Level: Intermediate</p>\n\n<p>Abstract: A large number of Agile adoption initiatives start at a grassroots level among software developers who have grown uncomfortable with the blatant inefficiencies of classic approaches to software development. The teams who succeed often find themselves working more efficiently, but the impact of their success is hindered. They are still relegated to taking large functional specifications and digesting them into iterations of work, with little if any feedback from the business side of the house. A series of successful sprints can still be met with the cliche \"that's not what we wanted\" response, leaving development teams relegated to the \"well that's what you wrote\" response. Until the business people are participating in iterative feedback and realizing the flexibility and freedom they have in working with these Agile teams, there will always be a ceiling on their success.</p>\n\n<p>Attendees of this talk will be guided through pragmatic, proven approaches for building that bridge to the business representatives. A thorough treatment of how user stories can be used as an effective tool that allows business and development sides of the house to meet in the middle, as well as when and how to bend in order to move the adoption process forward. It will also cover the sometimes subtle pitfalls and hotspots of promoting a fully Agile process with participating business team members, and ways to hopefully allow good deeds to continue to go unpunished.</p>\n\n<p>Presented By: Barry Hawkins</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: Barry Hawkins has played various roles in his 13 years in the software industry, from lone developer to team lead to Agile coach and mentor.

p.description = "<p>Technology/Platform: Java\nDifficulty Level: Beginner</p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Building a desktop application is a hard task, there are some many things to keep track of that many projects simply fail to meet their goals. Setting up the project structure keeping each artifact on a well identified location given its responsibility and type, defining the base schema for managing the application's life cycle, making sure the build is properly setup, and more. These are recurring tasks that should be handled by a tool or better yet, a framework. Griffon is such a framework. Inspired by the Grails framework Griffon aims to bring the same productivity gains to desktop development, there are so many traits shared by both frameworks that a Grails developer should be able to pick up the pace quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Presented By: Andres Almiray</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: Andres is a Java/Groovy developer with more than 10 years of experience in software design and development.

p.description = "<p>Technology/Platform: Other Languages\nDifficulty Level: Intermediate</p>\n\n<p>Abstract: MongoDB is an open-source, high-performance, schema-free, document-oriented database. The goal of the MongoDB project is to bridge the functionality gap between a key/value store and a traditional RDBMS. This talk will introduce MongoDB and discuss some of the reasons why MongoDB might be the right fit for your project.</p>\n\n<p>We'll introduce MongoDB by explaining how it compares to traditional relational databases as well as some other non-relational systems. This will focus on the gains in scalability and flexiblity that make MongoDB an attractive option, as well as some examples of when MongoDB might not be the best fit. Following this introduction we will discuss some specific use cases for MongoDB. This will include examples of interacting with MongoDB from several different languages. We will review some of the advanced features of MongoDB and discuss how they can be put to good use.</p>\n\n<p>Questions and discussion will be encouraged throughout the presentation, but some time will be allotted at the end specifically for Q&amp;A.</p>\n\n<p>Notes:\n- I filed this under Architecture and Design, but wasn't really sure where exactly it belonged. If you think it belongs in a different track feel free to adjust.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I also filed under Other Languages because there was no \"All Languages\" category. There are MongoDB drivers for all of the listed languages (and more), so the talk really applies to developers working in any of them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Presented By: Mike Dirolf</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: Mike Dirolf is a Software Engineer at 10gen, where he works on the MongoDB project.

While there have been open-source MVC frameworks for .NET, the recently released Microsoft ASP.NET MVC framework implements the MVC pattern using ASP.NET, making it readily available to all developers on the Microsoft platform.</p>\n\n<p>This session starts at File - New, and creates an ASP.NET MVC project. In addition to covering controllers and views, unit testing (using NUnit), dependency injection (using StructureMap), and data access (using LINQ and NHibernate) will also be covered. Best practices will also be presented to help avoid mistakes while adapting to this not-so-new style of web application development.</p>\n\n<p>Presented By: Chris Patterson</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: I am a Senior Architect at RelayHealth and a Microsoft C# MVP.

p.description = "<p>Technology/Platform: .NET\nDifficulty Level: Beginner</p>\n\n<p>Abstract: A number of technologies have been released in recent years which make building data driven applications easier. Starting with the declarative data models in LINQ and the Entity Framework, we are now able to build more dynamic applications quicker and easier than ever before. Building on top of LINQ, we now have the ability to present data dynamically through services (using ADO.Net Data Services) and web applications (using ASP.Net Dynamic Data). In both of these, we can consume our data models the way we need to rather than by needing constantly modify our external contracts (in terms of Stored Procedures or service contracts). The capabilities we have available to us are not limited to the base scaffolding, but allows for significant customization as necessary for our particular business needs. In addition, we can reuse our underlying models to enforce business requirements while retaining these dynamic capabilities. In Part 1, We'll focus on the data and services tiers.</p>\n\n<p>Presented By: Jim Wooley</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: Jim Wooley is a frequent speaker, member of the INETA Speaker Bureau, MVP, and author of \"LINQ in Action\".

p.description = "<p>Technology/Platform: Other Languages\nDifficulty Level: Intermediate</p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Building sexy software that users love is usually a challenging endeavor. The open source Flex SDK and your back-end of choice are a perfect combination of technologies for building rich, sexy software - for the web and the desktop. Flex applications can run in the browser using the ubiquitous Flash Player or on the desktop using Adobe AIR. In both instances your back-end of choice can be used for the server-side of the application. The communication between your back-end and Flex front-end can be a number of different communication protocols including SOAP, RESTful XML, JSON, and AMF. Using lots of live coding examples and demonstrations this session will cover the basics of using Flex to build sexy software for the web and the desktop.</p>\n\n<p>Presented By: James Ward</p>\n\n<p>About the Speaker: James Ward is a Technical Evangelist for Flex at Adobe and Adobe's JCP representative to JSR 286, 299, and 301.</p>\n\n<p>Much like his love for climbing mountains he enjoys programming because it provides endless new discoveries, elegant workarounds, summits and valleys. His adventures in climbing have taken him many places.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, technology has brought him many adventures, including: Pascal and Assembly back in the early 90's; Perl, HTML, and JavaScript in the mid 90's; then Java and many of it's frameworks beginning in the late 90's.</p>\n\n<p>Today he primarily uses Flex to build beautiful front-ends for Java based back-ends.

p.description = "<p>Technology/Platform: Other\nDifficulty Level: Beginner</p>\n\n<p>Abstract: Few tools have changed the way I work as much as the git source control system. Its distributed nature and lightweight branching and merging have made it possible for me to massage my code base in ways I couldn't have even imagined before using git.</p>\n\n<p>However, git has a reputation for being hard to learn. Because of its rather different approach to source control issues, many of the techniques we have learned in other source control systems do not translate cleanly when using git.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, we avoid the whole \"fear of git\" issue by not talking about git at all. Instead we introduce the \"Custom Source Control\" (CSC) system and build it up from first principles. In the end, we will ahve a completely functional, distributed source control system. And because each step in our journey of building CSC is simple and straight forward, we end up with a completely understandable system.</p>\n\n<p>So, this talk is not about git.

This talk is focused solely on how the languages are different - beyond the surface of syntax and into the heart of design. We will show the difference between a purely object-oriented language and a class based language. We will show you what problem an IOC container solves, and why you don't need one in Ruby.

His passions are Agile Development in the Enterprise, Ruby, and demonstrating to the Fortune 500 the elegance and power of this incredible language.</p>\n\n<p>Marc comes from a deeply rooted background in Java but began his fascination with other JVM languages after discovering the power and elegance of Ruby not possible in his beloved Java language. He has been exploring new language paradigms ever since.</p>\n\n<p>Marc now sets out to bring the power of the Ruby language to Java enterprises everywhere with the help of his trusty sidekick: JRuby, the Ruby implementation on the Java platform. Together, he and JRuby shall achieve unparalleled prosperity and business value for all who are willing to taste the glory of its sweet IT nectar.</p>\n\n<p>Leon has been bringing value to clients large and small for over ten years, and has a passion for technology, art and community. He has experience using technologies ranging from ASP.Net and C++, to Objective-C, Ajax, and Actionscript \u2013 and of course, Ruby and Rails.
