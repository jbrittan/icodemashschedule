DESCRIPTION:Technology/Platform: .NET\nDifficulty Level: Advanced\n\nAbstra
 ct: Technical debt\, the cost of putting off good development practices\, c
 an cripple a project's velocity\, flexibility\, and quality. This presentat
 ion will focus on a number of common anti-patterns such as "sensitive tests
 " which are brittle and overly coupled to odd situations which cause them t
 o fail. Having identified these behaviours\, we’ll look at techniques to fi
 rstly quantify the impacts via real world costing examples\, after which we
 'll walk through mitigation strategies such as buying components of a solut
 ion versus developing everything from scratch. You'll leave this session wi
 th a better idea of how to avoid these pitfalls\, and how to pull yourself 
 out of them if you do end up therein.\n\nPresented By: Gary Short\n\nAbout 
 the Speaker: Gary Short works for Developer Express as the Technical Evange
 list on the frameworks team. He has a deep interest in technical architectu
 re\, especially in the areas of technical debt and refactoring. Gary is a C
 # MVP and gives presentations at user groups and conferences throughout the
  UK.\n\nAs well as C#\, Gary also has an interest in dynamic languages such
  as Smalltalk\, Ruby and Python as well as iPhone development using Objecti
 ve-C.\n\nGary's ducelt tones can also be heard on the SodThis and the CodeC

 stract: The World of Warcraft (WoW) is today's most popular MMORPG\, with 1
 1.5 million subscribers generating an estimated $120+ million in monthly re
 venue for Blizzard Entertainment. Besides being a very successful video gam
 e\, WoW can also be examined as a case study for creating interesting and s
 calable applications. In this session\, we will demonstrate a handful of fe
 atures found in WoW\, including end-user interface customization using APIs
  and add-ons\, presence awareness\, realtime communication between users\, 
 data caching\, and offline access to application data. For each feature\, w
 e will investigate ways to build similar functionality into your own LOB ap
 plication using tools and technologies available today for free.\n\nPresent

 act: Return on Investment is key for large and small organizations in these
  risky times. A key mitigator of ROI risk is the avoidance of capital expen
 diture on IT infrastructure. While traditional Application Service Provider
  style hosting services do fit this bill\, there is a new service on the ho
 rizon that has key benefits over the ASP model - cloud computing. Cloud com
 puting leverages virtualized resources to isolate the developer and user fr
 om details of the infrastructure\, while spreading infrastructure capital e
 xpenses over a large number of hosted applications. Bill will discuss the r
 ealities of hosted applications\, including the current popular ASP models\
 , and compare them to cloud computing. There will be an overview of cloud c

 stract: The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that improve an
  Object Oriented design. They are:\n\n* Single Responsibility Principle\n* 
 Open/Closed Princip\n* Liskov Substitution Principle\n* Interface Segregati
 on Principle\n* Dependency Inversion Principle\n\nThe SOLID principles were
  written with a statically typed language (such as C++ or Java) in mind. Wh
 at do the SOLID principles mean to a dynamic/flexible language like Ruby? T
 his talk will focus on how SOLID and Ruby interact\, how to create well des
 igned Ruby software\, and to suggest possibilities for new design principle
 s for dynamic languages.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe 5 SOLID design principles form 
 a great foundation for understanding good Object Oriented design. But the S
 OLID principles were originally conceived with statically typed OO language
 s\, such as C++ and Java\, in mind. How well do these principles hold up wh
 en the implementation language is Ruby? Are the principles just as pertinen
 t as they were in Java\, or does the dynamic nature of Ruby change what we 
 mean by good design? In this presentation we will examine the SOLID princip
 les to understand their core purpose\, and then run them through the "Ruby 
 Filter" to see if any of these core principles survive. By understanding th
 ese principles\, we become better Ruby programmers.\n\nPresented By: Jim We

 ct: Learn how to leverage the elegance and expressiveness of Ruby to drive 
 development of a Mac OS X GUI application using its native UI framework\, C
 ocoa\, with the rapidly-progressing MacRuby implementation. MacRuby is "a v
 ersion of Ruby 1.9\, ported to run [on] Mac OS X [using] the Objective-C co
 mmon runtime and garbage collector". As we walk through implementing a desk
 top client to interface with popular URL shortening services\, we'll cover 
 how to pull down and build the latest version of MacRuby\, creating and wor
 king with Ruby domain objects\, the use of Apple's Interface Builder tool t
 o create the Cocoa GUI components\, and how to use HotCocoa\, a MacRuby DSL
  designed to create Cocoa interfaces in a much more streamlined manner.\n\n

 stract: What is "Web 2.0" or "Social media"? No one really knows. Ask ten e
 xperts and you will get ten different answers. And yet with every single da
 y that passes these terms race closer to ubiquity. Heck\, my grandmother re
 cently tried to "friend" me on Facebook.\n\nYet despite this popularity\, v
 ery few people really know what these terms represent. More importantly\, t
 he underlying concepts they represent when actually building a social appli
 cation. So\, as businesses choose to build or integrate these social featur
 es into their products\, designers and developers are faced with a challeng
 e on where to start.\n\nThis talk is going to walk through the history of t
 he social software movement and introduce the audience to the core underlyi
 ng concepts and methodologies for both designing and developing social appl
 ications. This includes but is not limited to\n\nSocial object theory\nWebb

  start-up company\, Within3. These communities connect health professionals
  around the world and better enable them to participate\, communicate\, and
  collaborate on patient cases and latest research\, all while helping to dr
 ive better medical outcomes for their patients.\n\nMy background in collabo
 ration\, information management\, data interoperability\, linguistics\, sea

 d\n\nAbstract: Chances are you code in a language that's either descended f
 rom C\, inspired by C\, or run in an interpreter that itself is written in 
 C. Still... do you actually know how to code in C? Despite its long-standin
 g position as a sort of "lingua franca"\, an agreed-upon common language\, 
 more and more developers are putting together successful\, satisfying caree
 rs\, without ever learning this seminal language. But what if you have to c
 all into C code from your favorite scripting language\, or use APIs like Op
 enGL that are written to be called from C? Many developers find C very chal
 lenging\, particularly its manual memory-management and other low-level con
 cerns. In this session\, we'll show you why you shouldn't be afraid of C\, 
 how you can use the skills you already have from the languages you code in 
 today\, and how to master structs\, enums\, typedefs\, malloc()\, free()\, 
 and the rest of C's sharp edges. Examples will be from the point-of-view of
  the C-skewing iPhone SDK\, but will be designed to be broadly applicable a
 nd platform-agnostic.\n\nPresented By: Chris Adamson\n\nAbout the Speaker:

 ct: The Java platform ecosystem harbors many languages besides Java. In tha
 t vast set of languages there is one that has received the title of “Next G

 se it embraces the language and extends it in a friendly and fluent way. Th
 at language is Groovy. Testing Java code can be cumbersome\, specially when
  rigid limits as verbose syntax and static typing get in the way. Groovy ca
 n help you write less code while retaining the same behavior\, it can also 
 test your Java production code without any special bridge between languages
 . Groovy integrates seamlessly with all Java libraries\, testing frameworks
  and IDEs\, which means you won’t be throwing away your Java knowledge\, yo
 u’ll just make it groovier.\n\nThis session will demonstrate Groovy aiding 
 Java tests in key areas as code verbosity\, mocking and producing/consuming
  XML.\n\nPresented By: Andres Almiray\n\nAbout the Speaker: Andres is a Jav

 Abstract: If you've used iPhone OS applications\, you've no doubt seen a nu
 mber of common tricks that are in no way obvious from looking at the docume
 ntation provided in the SDK. In this session\, we'll look at a grab-bag of 
 some of the most popular and least obvious techniques you'll want in your d
 eveloper's toolkit. These include:\n* Designing custom table cells visually
  with Interface Builder\, and using them in your app's tables\n* Using butt
 ons\, switches and other controls inside table cells\n* Animating changes i
 n your GUI (rotation resizes\, adding widgets\, etc.)\n* Gracefully handlin
 g interruptions from incoming calls\n* Alerting the user with vibration\n* 
 Figuring out if your network connection is wifi or cellular\n* Sharing info
 rmation between applications you've written\n* Building the "full" and "lit
 e" versions of your app from the same Xcode project and sources\n* Running 
 automated nightly builds from the command-line\n\nPresented By: Chris Adams

 stract: Funky Java\, Objective Scala\n\nSession Title: Funky Java\, Objecti
 ve Scala\n\nTagline: Polyglot programming is here\, and can improve your st
 yle. Suggestions on how to inject a little more functional style into your 
 Java\, and temper Scala with a mix of Object Oriented and Functional style.
 \n\nAbstract:\n\nRecently\, while the Java platform has been going from str
 ength to strength\, improving both performance and support for alternative 
 languages\, the Java language has started to appear less exciting than many
  of the alternatives that now run on the JVM. There is a lot to be said for
  the modern features of many of these new alternatives\, but does that mean
  the fat lady has sung for Java?\n\nNot so\, while we might still not have 
 closures or properties\, there are many new and interesting libraries and t
 echniques that can breathe new life and style into your Java source. A stro
 nger emphasis on immutable value objects\, use of third party libraries lik
 e the Google collections library\, DSL like fluent interfaces and more radi
 cal ideas like Project Lombok can all help you improve your style\, reduce 
 the boilerplate\, reduce errors and be more productive with Java. It will b
 ring fun back to your Java development.\n\nThe first part of this session w
 ill look at libraries and techniques that you can use with today's Java 6\,
  and a peek ahead to Java 7. Topics covered will include:\n\nImmutable valu
 e classes\nBuilder pattern and fluent APIs\nTypesafe "Multiple returns" wit
 h Pairs and Triples\nPredicates\, functions\, constraints\, identity maps a
 nd more with the Google Collections Library\n\nAt the same time\, alternati
 ve languages that offer much more than Java are emerging on the JVM. Scala 
 is one interesting option that offers static typing but with the same reduc
 tion of boilerplate and incidental complexity as many dynamically typed lan
 guages. Scala has a strong functional heritage\, but also excellent support
  for Object Orientation\, a fact that can greatly ease the transition to th
 is new language. By starting with a mix of OO and Functional\, the learning
  curve is lowered and the results are immediate.\n\nIn the second part of t
 his session we will look at Scala\, it similarities to Java\, and it's easy
  access improvements. Along the way\, some functional techniques will be in
 troduced where they make sense\, and where they make life easier. This is i
 ntended to be like easing into a warm swimming pool rather than diving in a
 t the deep end.\n\nAimed at beginner and intermediate developers\, this ses
 sion aims to help you improve your productivity and coding style.\n\nPresen

 ct: The first book on Domain-Driven Design was published in 2003\, authored
  by Eric Evans\, who first coined the term and distilled the time-tested pr
 inciples and patterns that make up the practice of DDD. In recent years\, s
 implification and increased testability through frameworks like Spring\, Hi
 bernate\, and others has substantially reduced the complexity of applicatio
 n infrastructure\, allowing teams to turn their focus to honing their appro
 ach to software design. Domain-Driven Design meets practitioners in that qu
 est with principles\, practices\, and process to recapture the spirit of so
 ftware excellence that has been lost in so many of today's technology pract
 ices.\n\nThis talk will introduce the foundations of Domain-Driven Design\,
  and present several facets of DDD in action:\n\n* How models are chosen an
 d evaluated\n* How multiple models coexist\n* How patterns help to avoid co
 mmon pitfalls\, such as overly-interconnected models\n* How developers and 
 domain experts together in a DDD team engage in deeper exploration of their
  problem domain and make that understanding tangible as a practical softwar
 e design\n\nPresented By: Barry Hawkins\n\nAbout the Speaker: Barry Hawkins

 stract: The Ruby community has always understood the importance of testing.
  They strive to make applications more testable while improving the approac
 hes and tools they use. As a result\, they have created some amazing framew
 orks and best practices to support testing\, both from the developers and t
 esters point of view. While this is great for Ruby developers\, it also is 
 extremely beneficial for ASP.net and C# developers. This session provides a

 g frameworks to create readable\, maintainable and valuable acceptance test
 s for ASP.net based web applications testing different parts of the applica
 tion including the business logic as well as the user interface in an autom

 umber can be used to verify not only that the application works as expected

DESCRIPTION:Technology/Platform: Other\nDifficulty Level: Beginner\n\nAbstr
 act: I have been practicing and coaching on kanban for 10 months now. I am 
 passionate about kanban because without a lot of ceremony and time\, I can 
 get a team to self organize and start communicating. Since constraints beco
 me visible\, it allows people to be more willing to go out of their comfort
  zone and thus wear any hat that it takes to produce quality software. Seei
 ng constraints\, pulling value and eliminating waste is the goal of practic
 ing kanban. This would be a "kanban explained" session for those who are no
 t familiar with this practice. I use physical boards to illustrate the conc
 epts and encourage good dialogue. We will discuss several types of kanban b
 oards such as WIP\, backlog and retrospectives.\n\nThis presentation has be
 en tested at many user group meetings\, at clients and in the open space fo
 rum at Agile 2009. The session takes 1 hour to present\, 1 1/2 hours to hav
 e good dialogue during the presentation.\n\nKanban\, while not a new concep
 t\, nor complex - it is often misunderstood by those who don't practice it.
  Intended audience is for people that understand agile story wall concepts 
 and whole team. The best audience is a Scrum master who will learn how kanb
 an can take their craft to the next level of a self organizing teams by see
 ing\, not hearing about constraints.\n\nPresented By: Jon Stahl\n\nAbout th
 e Speaker: Jon's passion is eliminating waste\, optimizing the performance 
 of IT teams and helping organizations become lean and agile. He has worked 
 directly with leadership teams of Fortune 500 organizations to reduce waste
  and improve delivery. He was named the agile leader and co-managed the tra
 nsformation of an organization with over 26 agile teams.\n\nHe is the co-or
 ganizer of Cleveland events such as Ignite Cleveland\, Cleveland Startup We
 ekend\, Cleveland Code Retreats\, and Cleveland Give Camp for IT Philanthro
 py. His company is located on a boat in downtown Cleveland and hosts ~10 te
 ch meetings a month.\n\nHis goal is to pair with the best in the industry t
 o improve our craft and improve the credibility of our community.

  pressure when you last typed “CREATE DATABASE latest_project\;” into your 
 MySQL console - or you might have been seeding the clouds in an attempt to 
 bring the thunder on faster.\n\nThe name of that storm? NoSQL.\n\nNew key-v
 alue stores seem to pop up daily\, document databases like CouchDB and Mong
 oDB get a great deal of press\, and RDF itself is built as a graph database
 . Given that\, and the fact that a number of domains just don’t map onto re
 lational databases very cleanly\, it behooves the development community to 
 learn about these alternatives. How do they differ from relational database
 s? In what situations are they best used? How hard is it to split up a doma
 in model into\, say\, a relational piece and a document piece - and is this
  ever worthwhile?\n\nI’ll answer those questions in this session\, and I’ll
  refer to actual problem domains while illustrating the answers. As it turn
 s out\, a document DB like CouchDB works very well for modeling biological 
 taxonomy - and a graph DB like Neo4J is a great fit for the (surprisingly c
 omplex) business of comic books. The NoSQL future is wide\, varied\, and ex
 citing - and it might even have a place for our old friends\, the relationa
 l DBs.\n\nPresented By: Ben Scofield\n\nAbout the Speaker: Ben Scofield is

 ct: A number of technologies have been released in recent years which make 
 building data driven applications easier. Starting with the declarative dat
 a models in LINQ and the Entity Framework\, we are now able to build more d
 ynamic applications quicker and easier than ever before. Building on top of
  LINQ\, we now have the ability to present data dynamically through service
 s (using ADO.Net Data Services) and web applications (using ASP.Net Dynamic
  Data). In both of these\, we can consume our data models the way we need t
 o rather than by needing constantly modify our external contracts (in terms
  of Stored Procedures or service contracts). The capabilities we have avail
 able to us are not limited to the base scaffolding\, but allows for signifi
 cant customization as necessary for our particular business needs. In addit
 ion\, we can reuse our underlying models to enforce business requirements w
 hile retaining these dynamic capabilities. In Part 2\, we'll look at the UI
  portion of our web applications and see how we can take advantage of the f
 lexabile data structures we built in part 1.\n\nPresented By: Jim Wooley\n\

 stract: A large number of Agile adoption initiatives start at a grassroots 
 level among software developers who have grown uncomfortable with the blata
 nt inefficiencies of classic approaches to software development. The teams 
 who succeed often find themselves working more efficiently\, but the impact
  of their success is hindered. They are still relegated to taking large fun
 ctional specifications and digesting them into iterations of work\, with li
 ttle if any feedback from the business side of the house. A series of succe
 ssful sprints can still be met with the cliche "that's not what we wanted" 
 response\, leaving development teams relegated to the "well that's what you
  wrote" response. Until the business people are participating in iterative 
 feedback and realizing the flexibility and freedom they have in working wit
 h these Agile teams\, there will always be a ceiling on their success.\n\nA
 ttendees of this talk will be guided through pragmatic\, proven approaches 
 for building that bridge to the business representatives. A thorough treatm
 ent of how user stories can be used as an effective tool that allows busine
 ss and development sides of the house to meet in the middle\, as well as wh
 en and how to bend in order to move the adoption process forward. It will a
 lso cover the sometimes subtle pitfalls and hotspots of promoting a fully A

 ly allow good deeds to continue to go unpunished.\n\nPresented By: Barry Ha

 ct: The Rails Rumble is a 48-hour innovation competition in which teams of 
 up to four developers embrace their environmental constraints to create a n
 umber of compelling microapps with Ruby and Rails. In this panel we’ll talk
  to a number of Rumble participants and discover the tips\, tricks\, and te
 chniques they used to successfully launch innovative web properties in an e
 xtremely short time frame.\n\nPanelists will include a number of winners an
 d other developers/designers who performed impressive feats during both the
  2007\, 2008\, and 2009 contests. Questions will be taken before the confer
 ence starts\, but attendees should come prepared with lots of questions for
  the panelists\, such as:\n\nHow they leveraged Rails and open source softw
 are to help them succeed.\nHow they scoped their projects and structured th
 eir applications to enable them to launch early and iterate often.\nHow the
 y embraced the mantra of “simplest thing that could possibly work”\, removi
 ng extraneous features and setting reasonable goals for themselves.\nHow th
 ey found partners whose skills complemented their own\, and how they organi
 zed their team.\nGeneral productivity tips and work habit recommendations.\
 nTheir advice will be applicable to both future innovation competitions (su
 ch as the upcoming Rails Rumbles) as well as to any project that attendees 
 may hope to bootstrap in their own copious spare time. We’ll also discuss h
 ow to get involved with innovation competitions and why their condensed nat
 ure and marketing opportunities can be a great motivator.\n\nPanelists incl

DESCRIPTION:Technology/Platform: .NET\nDifficulty Level: Beginner\n\nAbstra
 ct: A number of technologies have been released in recent years which make 
 building data driven applications easier. Starting with the declarative dat
 a models in LINQ and the Entity Framework\, we are now able to build more d
 ynamic applications quicker and easier than ever before. Building on top of
  LINQ\, we now have the ability to present data dynamically through service
 s (using ADO.Net Data Services) and web applications (using ASP.Net Dynamic
  Data). In both of these\, we can consume our data models the way we need t
 o rather than by needing constantly modify our external contracts (in terms
  of Stored Procedures or service contracts). The capabilities we have avail
 able to us are not limited to the base scaffolding\, but allows for signifi
 cant customization as necessary for our particular business needs. In addit
 ion\, we can reuse our underlying models to enforce business requirements w
 hile retaining these dynamic capabilities. In Part 1\, We'll focus on the d
 ata and services tiers.\n\nPresented By: Jim Wooley\n\nAbout the Speaker: J
 im Wooley is a frequent speaker\, member of the INETA Speaker Bureau\, MVP\
 , and author of "LINQ in Action". He is always striving to stay at the fore
 front of technology and enjoys the thrill of a new challenge. He has been a

 diate\n\nAbstract: Building sexy software that users love is usually a chal
 lenging endeavor. The open source Flex SDK and your back-end of choice are 
 a perfect combination of technologies for building rich\, sexy software - f
 or the web and the desktop. Flex applications can run in the browser using 
 the ubiquitous Flash Player or on the desktop using Adobe AIR. In both inst
 ances your back-end of choice can be used for the server-side of the applic
 ation. The communication between your back-end and Flex front-end can be a 
 number of different communication protocols including SOAP\, RESTful XML\, 
 JSON\, and AMF. Using lots of live coding examples and demonstrations this 
 session will cover the basics of using Flex to build sexy software for the 
 web and the desktop.\n\nPresented By: James Ward\n\nAbout the Speaker: Jame
 s Ward is a Technical Evangelist for Flex at Adobe and Adobe's JCP represen
 tative to JSR 286\, 299\, and 301.\n\nMuch like his love for climbing mount
 ains he enjoys programming because it provides endless new discoveries\, el
 egant workarounds\, summits and valleys. His adventures in climbing have ta
 ken him many places.\n\nLikewise\, technology has brought him many adventur
 es\, including: Pascal and Assembly back in the early 90's\; Perl\, HTML\, 
 and JavaScript in the mid 90's\; then Java and many of it's frameworks begi
 nning in the late 90's.\n\nToday he primarily uses Flex to build beautiful 
 front-ends for Java based back-ends. Prior to Adobe\, James built a rich ma
 rketing and customer service portal for Pillar Data Systems.

 act: Few tools have changed the way I work as much as the git source contro
 l system. Its distributed nature and lightweight branching and merging have
  made it possible for me to massage my code base in ways I couldn't have ev
 en imagined before using git.\n\nHowever\, git has a reputation for being h
 ard to learn. Because of its rather different approach to source control is
 sues\, many of the techniques we have learned in other source control syste
 ms do not translate cleanly when using git.\n\nIn this talk\, we avoid the 
 whole "fear of git" issue by not talking about git at all. Instead we intro
 duce the "Custom Source Control" (CSC) system and build it up from first pr
 inciples. In the end\, we will ahve a completely functional\, distributed s
 ource control system. And because each step in our journey of building CSC 
 is simple and straight forward\, we end up with a completely understandable
  system.\n\nSo\, this talk is not about git. But attendees will end up with
  a deeper understanding of the principles behind git.\n\nDid I mention this
  talk is not about git? No\, really! It's not. <wink/>\n\nPresented By: Jim
